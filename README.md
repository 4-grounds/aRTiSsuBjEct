This project is a simple coding artwork that conceptualizes the idea of math language.
By showing the simple question of 2 plus 2 equaling something that is not the number 4.
This was done by treating these numbers as String variable instead of a Numeric variable.
Then the system randomly chooses from a tuple of different Strings and combines it with 
the "2 + 2 =" String.
